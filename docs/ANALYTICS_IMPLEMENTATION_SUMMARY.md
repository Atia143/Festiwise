# FestiWise Analytics Implementation Summary

## Overview

We've implemented a comprehensive analytics tracking system for FestiWise that tracks the complete user journey from landing page views to quiz completion, match viewing, outbound clicks, and email opt-ins.

## Key Implementation Components

1. **Core Analytics Module** (`/src/lib/analytics-tracker.ts`)
   - Provides consistent tracking across GA4 and Vercel Analytics
   - Implements all required event types with standardized parameters
   - Handles UTM parameter tracking and device/country information

2. **Quiz Analytics** (`/src/hooks/useQuizAnalytics.ts`)
   - Tracks quiz start, completion, match viewing, and outbound clicks
   - Measures quiz completion time and question count
   - Tracks which matches users view and interact with

3. **Newsletter Analytics** (`/src/hooks/useNewsletterAnalytics.ts`, `/src/hooks/useNewsletterSignup.ts`)
   - Tracks email submissions across all placement types
   - Records success/failure status
   - Provides consistent implementation for all newsletter forms

4. **Page View Tracking** (`/src/components/Analytics/ClientAnalytics.tsx`)
   - Automatically tracks landing page views with referrer information
   - Captures UTM parameters and attribution data
   - Integrated into the application's root layout

## Event Types Implemented

   - Triggers on initial page load
   - Captures referrer, UTM parameters, device, country

2. **Quiz Start**
   - Triggers when user begins the quiz

4. **Match View**

5. **Outbound Click**
   - Triggers when user clicks festival websites or ticket links

6. **Email Opt-In**
   - Triggers when user submits email in any form
   - Captures placement (hero, footer, popup, quiz-results), submission status, device

## Integration Points

The analytics system has been integrated at the following key points:

- **Quiz Components**: For tracking quiz flow and match viewing
- **Festival Results**: For tracking outbound clicks and interactions
- **Newsletter Forms**: For tracking email opt-ins

## Next Steps
