# 🎉 RUNTIME ERROR FIXED & INTERNATIONAL LAUNCH COMPLETE! ✅

## 🔧 **RUNTIME ERROR RESOLUTION**

### **Issue Identified:**
```
Runtime TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'call')
at RootLayout (src/app/layout.tsx:143:9)
```

### **Root Cause:**
The `LanguageSystem` component was incorrectly implemented as a standalone component instead of a provider wrapper, causing React context issues during runtime.

### **Solution Implemented:**
1. ✅ **Fixed Layout Structure**: Replaced `<LanguageSystem />` with `<LanguageProvider>` wrapper
2. ✅ **Enhanced Error Handling**: Updated `useLanguage` hook to return safe defaults for SSG/SSR
3. ✅ **Created Dedicated Component**: Added `LanguageSwitcher.tsx` for UI language switching
4. ✅ **Removed Dashboard**: Eliminated unnecessary dashboard page per user request
